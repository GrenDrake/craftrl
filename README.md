# CraftRL

CraftRL is an open world sandbox game inspired with a classic roguelike aesthetic.
It was inspired by games like Minecraft, Dragon Quest Builders 2, and Animal Crossing.

Currently it is in a fairly early stage of development.

## Requirements

CraftRL's only external dependancy is [BearLibTerminal](http://foo.wyrd.name/en:bearlibterminal).

## Installation

Currently, CraftRL is only available by building from source.
It is written using C++ and includes a makefile that can be used to build it.
This makefile will need to be updated to point to the location of your BearLibTerminal install.

## License

CraftRL is released under the [GPL v3 License](LICENSE).
The included font is from the [Fira Typeface](https://github.com/mozilla/Fira) and is used and provided under the terms of the SIL Open Font License.
